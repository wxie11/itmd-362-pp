## ITMD 362, Production Problem 03: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette
(you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make).
Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=14W0T0k00ZmYEeQ++3ZZX88++hP
Your Rationale: I chose White color as the base color since it is an information-based website,
so the color white gives cleanliness. The secondary color, Purple, gives a feeling of mystery
since the product probably is not released yet.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=52q0J0kiCFn8GVde7NVmtwSqXtg
Your Rationale: Green is my base color because it is the color of nature so the best color to
use in websites about Botanical Gardens. When it come to springtime, Yellow is color of
sunshine and blue is color of sky, what a nice weather. (I chose a color in between green
and blue because it matches with other two colors.)

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=31s0u0kwi++bu++hX++++rd++kX
Your Rationale: I chose these three colors because the site is typically designed for kids. Bright
colors appeal to kids so can easily grab their attentions. Colors affect emotions and behaviors:
Yellow brings happiness, Blue has calming effect, Purple carries power.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=a4e050kJS6KvW5fuP8MNdeqCnl7
Your Rationale: I chose dark blue and red because when I think of cybersecurity, it is behind the
screen where people can not see, dark colors are my top choice. Dark blue representing knowledge
and seriousness. The color Red has high visibility which also stimulate people to make decisions,
it is good for advertising, can use for 'Sign up Now' in this case.
